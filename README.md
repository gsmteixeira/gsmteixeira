## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics working at the interface between **machine learning, Bayesian inference, and observational astronomy**. My research focuses on developing **uncertainty-aware, physically grounded ML methods** for large-scale surveys and time-domain astronomy, with particular interest in sparse and irregular data regimes.

My work spans applications from **photometric redshift estimation** to **transient characterization**, combining deep learning with differentiable physical models and probabilistic inference.
