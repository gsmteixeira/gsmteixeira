### Hi there 👋

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=YOUR_USERNAME&color=orange)

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Astrophysics at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas (CBPF), Brazil.  
My research focuses on applying **machine learning and statistical inference** to astrophysical problems, particularly in **time-domain astronomy** and **large survey data**.

- Working on ML-driven inference for sparse astronomical data
- Interested in Bayesian methods, uncertainty quantification, and differentiable models
- Contributor to large collaborations including **S-PLUS**, **DELVE**, **CHANCES (4MOST)**, and **Fink**
- Check out my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/) *(link)*

## Main research interests
- Time-domain astronomy & transients (Type II supernovae)
- Machine learning for astrophysics
- Bayesian inference & uncertainty quantification
- Photometric redshifts and large surveys (LSST, Euclid)

*I enjoy building models that respect both the data and the physics behind them.*
